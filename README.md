# Cryptocurrency Breakout Trading Strategy

## Overview

Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Breakout Trading Strategy repository! This project aims to empower cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders with a straightforward yet effective trading strategy for Bitcoin (BTC-USD). By utilizing Python and the yfinance library, this strategy identifies potential buy and sell signals based on the breakout of Bitcoin's price from a carefully selected moving average.

Cryptocurrency markets have gained immense popularity and attention in recent years. However, their inherent volatility and complex price movements can make trading a challenging endeavor. This strategy is designed to simplify trading decisions by offering a systematic approach to capture potential price breakouts, which can lead to profitable opportunities.

In this README, I'll provide an overview of the strategy's key components, including the cryptocurrency and timeframe of analysis, the moving average used for trend identification, breakout criteria, and risk management principles. Additionally, I'll guide you through the steps to use and customize the strategy to suit your trading preferences.

## Strategy Details

- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

Bitcoin, as one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies, serves as the primary asset for this strategy. Its historical price data will be used to test and implement the strategy.

- **Timeframe**: Historical price data from 2010-01-01 to 2024-01-01.

This extensive historical dataset allows us to evaluate the strategy's performance across various market conditions.

- **Moving Average**: Simple Moving Average (SMA) with a 200-day period.

The SMA smoothes out price data, providing a clearer view of the underlying trend.

- **Breakout Threshold**: A 2% breakout above the SMA.

This means that when the cryptocurrency's price rises above the SMA by 2% or more, it triggers a potential entry point.

- **Risk Management**: A 5% stop-loss and a 10% profit target.

 To protect against losses, the strategy employs a 5% stop-loss mechanism. This ensures that if the trade moves against us, we limit potential losses to a manageable level. Additionally, a 10% profit target is set to capture gains when the trade moves in our favor.
